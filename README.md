# TempGBA4PSP-mod
One of many versions of TempGBA4PSP (and parent projects) which I have modified 

### Building
In order to build ensure that you have the PSP SDK installed and simple navagate to the `build`  derectory and open Command Line or PowerShell and run `make`. From here you will build the `EBOOT.PBP` which you can then run on your PSP.
